            <h3>CURRY</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Curry is a dish with a sauce seasoned with spices, mainly associated with South Asian cuisine.
                In southern India, leaves from the curry tree may be included.
                There are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on
                regional cultural tradition and personal preferences. Such dishes have names that refer to their
                ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from
                Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk or spice pastes, commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain
                fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are
                vegetarian.
                Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other
                ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy
                based
                on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume purée, sautéed crushed onion,
                or
                tomato purée.

            <h3>TANDOORI CHICKEN</h3>
            One of the most recognized Indian dishes throughout the world. It is prepared by macerating the pieces in
            yogurt to which various spices such as cumin, garlic, ginger, 'tandoori masala' and cayenne have previously
            been added to make it spicy. It is then cooked in the 'tandoor', a typical Indian clay oven, or on a grill.
            It is usually accompanied by rice.
            Skinless legs and thighs are marinated in a tenderizing mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices and the
            meat is slashed to the bone in several places helping the marinade penetrate and the chicken cook more
            quickly.
            The chicken gets its characteristic red hue from either lots of fiery chile or the addition of red food dye.
            We're not that big on food dyes here, so we've skipped it, but if you must have your chicken bright red,
            feel free to add a bit of red food dye to the marinade.
            You don't need a tandoor oven to make tandoori chicken! (Thank goodness). You can cook it over a grill
            (charcoal preferred) or just in an oven with a broiler.

            <h3>LASSI</h3>
            The famous Indian liquid yogurt. This ingredient is widely used to cool the torrid Indian temperatures. It
            is taken as an accompaniment, as an ingredient in some preparations or in the form of a drink, in which case
            it is seasoned with spices such as cumin or pepper. It is also possible to drink it sweet, shaken with sugar
            and fruits such as mango, papaya or banana. On some religious festivities it is taken seasoned with 'bhang',
            a derivative of cannabis (legal in many territories of the country).
